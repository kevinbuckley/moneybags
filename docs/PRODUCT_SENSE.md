# PRODUCT_SENSE.md — MoneyBags Product Vision

## What Is MoneyBags?

MoneyBags is a financial simulator that lets anyone invest fake money in real instruments across real historical events — and watch (or step through) what would have happened. It's eTrade if eTrade had a sense of humor and didn't want your real money.

## Who Is It For?

- Curious people who've heard about the 2008 crash but want to *feel* it
- Finance-curious folks who don't know what an iron condor is but want to try one
- People who want to understand complex instruments without losing real money
- WSB-adjacent users who want to test "what if I YOLOed into TSLA calls in 2019"
- Finance students wanting a sandbox with no consequences

## Core User Promise

> You can try anything here. You won't lose real money. You might learn something. You will be mocked gently.

## Product Principles

1. **Immediate gratification.** No sign-up. No tutorial wall. Start simulating in under 60 seconds.
2. **Real enough to be useful.** Real instruments, real historical data, real financial math. Not a toy, a simulator.
3. **Snarky, never mean.** The humor punches at finance culture, not the user. Users should feel smart for trying complex things, not stupid for losing fake money.
4. **Mobile-first, always.** The primary experience is on a phone. Desktop is a bonus. Every design decision starts with 375px.
5. **Complexity is optional.** A beginner can pick SPY, pick 2020, and hit play. An expert can build multi-condition rules across a dispersion trade. Both experiences are valid.
6. **Show your work.** Analytics exist not just to show results but to teach. Sharpe ratio gets a one-line explanation. Drawdown has a tooltip. Finance literacy is a side effect.

## What MoneyBags Is NOT

- A real trading platform
- Financial advice
- A game with fictional assets or made-up rules
- A social network (v1)
- Paywalled in any meaningful way (ads are ambient, not gates)

## Success Metrics (qualitative for v1)

- Users complete at least one full simulation
- Users share at least one results card
- Users try at least two different scenarios
- No user feels confused about whether this is real money
